This directory provides a full example for the fitting process in echelle spectra, following the recommended procedure.

The input data is a CTIO-1.5m/CHIRON spectrum of a rapidly-rotating B-type star.

The fitting procedure is:
1: Find some echelle orders with mostly water moderate to strong water lines.
2: Fit those orders only, recording the best-fit humidity value using the fitter.GetValue() method
3: Determine the average water fit from each of the orders you fit.
4: Repeat steps 1-3 with oxygen.
5: Apply the best-fit humidity and o2 mixing ratio to every order by using the fitter.GenerateModel method.
