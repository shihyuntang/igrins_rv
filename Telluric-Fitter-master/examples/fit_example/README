This example demonstrates the fitting process. The input data is of a rapidly rotating B star, and the spectral lines of the primary have been smoothed out to leave only the sharp telluric lines.
If everything is installed correctly, you should be able to run the example by typing 
   python Fit.py
After the fit is done, it will use matplotlib to plot both a comparison of the fit to the data, and the telluric-corrected data.
