## Public Release
* **2022/10/11: IGRINS RV v1.5.1!!**\
  *What's new?:*
  1. Significantly reduced the K band RV shift between orders.
  2. Removed choice between *relative* and *absolute* RV modes (for both H and K band). Now only absolute RVs are calculated, but an order-to-order RV correction is still applied, and the uncertainties provided are updated to take into account this correction. (for more info, see {doc}`What to Know About v1.5.1 Update`)
  3. Dropped the usage of Order 3 for K band RV calculation, as well as Order 4 during the period when IGRINS was slightly defocused as the result of a mounting issue.
* 2022/05/23: **IGRINS RV** v1.0.1
  1. Move stuff from the wiki page to the readthedocs site for version control.
