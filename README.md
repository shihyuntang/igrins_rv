# IGRINS Radial Relocity Pipeline [IGRINS RV](https://github.com/shihyuntang/igrins_rv)


``IGRINS RV`` is a ``python`` open source pipeline for extracting radial velocity (RV) for the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) instrument. It's core technique use a modified forward modeling technique that utilize the telluric absorption lines as the common-path wavelength calibrator. With RV precision at K band around 25 m/s and H band 50 m/s, ``IGRINS RV`` had successfully retrieval of planet-induced RV signals for both HD 189733 and &tau; Boo A. Visit [Stahl et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..283S/abstract) to see the published paper.

***
The best way to learn how IGRINS RV works is to first play with the example data following steps in [Demo Run With Example Data of GJ281](https://github.com/shihyuntang/igrins_rv/wiki/Demo-Run-With-Example-Data-of-GJ281). While you are waiting for the example code to finish, please read all detailed documentation on the [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/shihyuntang/igrins_rv/wiki) so you know how to change the command to fit your OWN science targets:

If you use ``IGRINS RV`` in any of your work, please go to the [FAQ page](https://github.com/shihyuntang/igrins_rv/wiki/FAQ#q-how-do-i-properly-cite-igrins-rv) to see how to properly cite ``IGRINS RV``:
