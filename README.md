# IGRINS Radial Relocity Pipeline [IGRINS RV](https://github.com/shihyuntang/igrins_rv)

**This package is NOT yet ready for public use**

``IGRINS RV`` is a ``python`` open source pipeline for extracting radial velocity (RV) for the IGRINS instrument. It's core technique use a modified forward modeling technique that utilize the telluric absorption lines as the common-path wavelength calibrator. With RV precision at K band around 25 m/s and H band 50 m/s, ``IGRINS RV`` had successfully retrieval of planet-induced RV signals for both HD 189733 and &tau; Boo A. Visit [arXiv, comming soon]() to see the published paper.

``IGRINS RV`` is now under intense development. \
