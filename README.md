# IGRINS Radial Relocity Pipeline

This is a pipeline under development for extracting radial velocity (RV) from the IGRINS instrument.
This package is **NOT yet** ready for public use.
Please contact asa.stahl@rice.edu or sytang@lowell.edu for more detail.

News:\
**2020/08/04: igrins_rv v0.9-beta.1 public beta is under internal review and testing!!**\
2020/06/23: igrins_rv v0.85 is under internal review.. will come to public soon!!

**IGRINS RV**'s core technique use a modified forward modeling technique that utilize the telluric absorption lines as the common-path wavelength calibrator. With RV precision at K band around 30 m/s and H band 50 m/s, **IGRINS RV** had successfully retrieval of planet-induced RV signals for both HD 189733 and &tau; Boo A.\

**IGRINS RV** is now under intense development.
